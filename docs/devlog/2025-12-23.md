**Session goal:** Start to work on the balancing algorithem again

## What I worked on

Made a decision to use a simpler B+Tree implementation for now to get a MVP working.

## What's next

The next step is to simplify the balancing algorithm to remove the siblings borrowing functionality and rewrite new unit
tests.
